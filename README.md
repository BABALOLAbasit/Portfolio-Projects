# Data Exploration of Covid-19 Dataset in SQL Server

## Project Overview

### Introduction

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a Covid-19 dataset using SQL Server. The dataset includes information on Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various locations and continents. The aim is to gain insights into the pandemic's impact, analyze infection and death rates, and assess the progress of vaccination campaigns.

### Objectives

**. Explore Covid-19 Data:** Retrieve and examine key metrics such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population data.

**. Analyze Infection and Death Rates:** Calculate and compare infection rates and death percentages across different locations.

**. Assess Vaccination Progress:** Evaluate vaccination data to understand the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.

**. Data Transformation:** Clean and transform the data to make it suitable for detailed analysis and visualization.

### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of Covid-19 data, highlighting the importance of data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using SQL Server. The insights gained from this analysis can help understand the pandemic's impact and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts across different regions. The SQL queries used in this project demonstrate various techniques for data exploration and preparation, making it a valuable resource for similar data analysis tasks.
